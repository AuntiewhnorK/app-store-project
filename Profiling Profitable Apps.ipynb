Getting by with basic storage cleaner and analyzer facilities won't be enough to compete. We would need more features such as sorting apps by size or when they were last used, when they were downloaded, etc. We also need to keep in mind of different Android versions so our app runs smoothly.

We concluded a storage analyzer app would be the most profitable. The App Store market is more about entertainment, while the Play Store market is more balanced towards entertainment and productivity. A productivity app would certainly thrive in both environments with time. "
