# Profitable App Project

A Dataquest guided project working with Google Play and Apple Store data sets. I answer the question of what are the most popular genres and categories in Google Play (from 2019) and the Apple Store (from 2018), and for a fictional company, create a successful app profile based on the data. My incentive was getting experience reading and analyzing data.
